# DevOps Infrastructure Provisioning & Configuration Automation Project

## Overview

This project is a Python-based automation tool developed as part of a DevOps course that simulates infrastructure provisioning and service configuration. It demonstrates fundamental DevOps concepts including infrastructure as code, automation, and modular programming practices.

The tool allows users to define virtual machines (VMs) dynamically, validates input using Python with Pydantic, and automates service installation using Bash scripts. While currently operating in simulation mode, the modular architecture is designed to support future integration with real cloud providers like AWS and Terraform.

## Project Objectives

- **Accept and validate user inputs** for defining virtual machines
- **Implement modular code structure** using Python classes and proper imports
- **Automate service installation** using Bash scripts integration
- **Provide comprehensive logging** and error handling throughout the application
- **Simulate infrastructure provisioning** in preparation for real cloud integration

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+** (Python 3.8+ recommended)
- **Python3 venv** (python3 virtual environment package installed)
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Bash shell** (for service installation scripts)
- **Git** (for version control)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd infra-automation
```

### 2. Set Up Python Virtual Environment

Creating and using a virtual environment is a best practice that isolates your project dependencies from your system Python installation.

#### On Linux/macOS:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Verify you're in the virtual environment (optional)
which python
# Should show: /path/to/your/project/venv/bin/python
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check installed packages
pip list

# Should show pydantic and its dependencies
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run:

```bash
python infra_simulator.py
```

### Interactive Workflow

1. **Start the Application**: The tool will prompt if you want to provision machines
2. **Define VM Specifications**: Enter details for each virtual machine:
   - **VM Name**: Must start with a letter, can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores
   - **Operating System**: Choose from ubuntu or centos
   - **CPU Cores**: Number of CPU cores (positive number)
   - **RAM**: Memory allocation in GB (positive number)
3. **Validation**: The system automatically validates all inputs using Pydantic
4. **Service Installation**: After VM definition, the tool automatically attempts to install Nginx on each machine
5. **Logging**: All activities are logged to `logs/provisioning.log`

### Example Session

```
Would you like to provision machines? (yes/no) yes

Enter a VM Name: web-server-01
Select the desired OS to be deployed to the VM: (Supported OS: ubuntu/centos) ubuntu
Insert the desired number of VM CPU cores (eg: 4): 2
Insert the desired number of RAM to be allocated to the VM (size unit is in GB. eg: 16): 8

Would you like to provision another machine? (yes/no) no

Trying to install Nginx on 'web-server-01'..
```

### Expected Output Files

After running the application, you'll find:

- **`configs/instances.json`**: Contains your VM specifications in JSON format
- **`configs/nginx_servers.txt`**: Lists machines with Nginx installed
- **`logs/provisioning.log`**: Detailed execution logs with timestamps

## Virtual Environment Management

### Why Use Virtual Environments?

Virtual environments provide isolated Python environments for your projects, preventing dependency conflicts between different projects.

### Managing Your Virtual Environment

```bash
# Activate virtual environment (run this each time you work on the project)
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS

# Install new packages (only when venv is activated)
pip install package-name

# Update requirements.txt after installing new packages
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Deactivate virtual environment when done
deactivate

# Remove virtual environment (if needed)
rm -rf venv  # Linux/macOS
```

### Troubleshooting Virtual Environment

If you encounter issues:

```bash
# Recreate virtual environment
rm -rf venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code Architecture

## Logging

The application maintains detailed logs in `logs/provisioning.log` with the following information:
- Application start/stop events
- VM creation and validation results
